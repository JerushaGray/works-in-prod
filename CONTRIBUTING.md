# 🧭 Contributing to Works in Prod

> *Because everything’s technically a work in progress — especially in production.*

Thanks for stopping by! **Works in Prod** isn’t a traditional open-source project —  
it’s a live portfolio experiment that happens to run like a real system.  
That means you’re absolutely welcome to **read, fork, and learn**, but please keep a few things in mind:

---

## 🧠 What This Project Is
- A MarTech observability demo built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Vercel**.  
- A showcase of systems thinking, operational humor, and clear documentation.  
- A living artifact: part proof-of-concept, part philosophy lab.

## 🚫 What It’s Not
- A production dependency for your business.  
- A polished product with a feature roadmap or support queue.  
- Immune to minor chaos — it *works in prod*, not necessarily in staging.

## 🧩 Ways to Contribute

### 🪶 1. Read & Remix
Clone or fork the repo, explore the structure, and adapt any ideas or logic for your own experiments.  
Credit is appreciated but not required — curiosity is the point.

### 🛠️ 2. Fix a Typo or Broken Link
If you spot a small issue, PRs are welcome.  
Please:
- Keep commits atomic (`fix:`, `docs:`, or `chore:` prefixes are great).  
- Use clear commit messages.  
- Stay within the existing tone — calm, precise, a little dry.

### 💡 3. Start a Conversation
You can open a discussion or issue if you’ve built something inspired by *Works in Prod*.  
Think of it less like “reporting a bug” and more like “sharing field notes.”
