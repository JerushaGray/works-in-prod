# 🧩 Code of Conduct

> *Clarity, curiosity, and calm — even in production.*

The **Works in Prod** project exists to demonstrate that systems, creativity, and humor can coexist.  
Everyone who reads, forks, or contributes is part of that story — so let’s keep it constructive, clear, and kind.

## 🧠 Core Principles

1. **Be kind.**  
   Respect time, effort, and context. We’re all debugging something.

2. **Be clear.**  
   Communicate your intent. Write good commit messages.  
   If something breaks, describe *what* and *why* — not *who*.

3. **Be curious.**  
   This is a sandbox for learning. Treat mistakes as data, not failures.

4. **Be human.**  
   Humor welcome. Sarcasm optional. Cruelty never.

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind.  
- Spamming issues or discussions with irrelevant content.  
- Overwriting or removing author attribution.  
- Using this work for malicious or unethical purposes.

## 🧭 Reporting

If you encounter behavior that violates these standards, you can:  
- Open a GitHub issue marked **[Code of Conduct]**, or  
- Email the maintainer directly at **jerusha.gray@protonmail.com** (or your preferred contact).  

Reports are reviewed privately, calmly, and respectfully.

## ⚙️ Enforcement

- Minor issues → polite clarification or note in discussion.  
- Major or repeated violations → blocked or banned from repo activity.  
- Appeals can be made through respectful dialogue — clarity first, ego last.
