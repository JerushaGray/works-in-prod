- **Dynamic Charting:** Recharts integrated with smooth client hydration and Framer Motion fade-in transitions.  
- **Smart Supabase Context:** Separate server and browser clients for reliable SSR/CSR operation on Vercel.  
- **Type-Safe Queries:** Auto-generated Supabase types for strict compile-time safety.  
- **Polished UI:** Responsive, accessible, and consistent visual design with purple (`#9333ea`) and green (`#84cc16`) accents.  
- **Secure Environment Separation:** Server and client keys isolated for predictable behavior in Next.js App Router.
