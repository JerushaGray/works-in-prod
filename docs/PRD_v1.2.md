## 1 · Product Overview

**Works in Prod** is a live MarTech-operations observability app and personal portfolio hub.  
It proves that clarity, governance, and humor can coexist in production.  

**Tagline →** “I build systems that work — at least once.”

## 3 · Scope

### ✅ In Scope (v0.1)
- Stack inventory + integration map  
- Hourly metric drift via Supabase heartbeat  
- Ops Feed (log of runs + humor)  
- About page with ethos and links  
- Responsive UI deployed to [worksinprod.com](https://worksinprod.com)

### 🚫 Out of Scope
Auth, live vendor APIs, multi-user features.

## 4 · Brand Voice & Tone

> “Clarity only matters if it survives production.”

**Voice:** calm · competent · wryly self-aware  
**Humor:** appears in microcopy (loading states, footers) only  
**Visual:** neutral palette + success-green accents  

**Sample Microcopy**
- “Deploying good intentions…”  
- “Stable (ish).”  
- “Last checked: still works in prod.”

---

## 5 · User Experience

**Flow:**  
`Home → Stack Dashboard → Ops Feed → About → Labs (placeholder)`

**Key Actions**
- View stack table and integration graph  
- Observe metrics (health, latency, uptime)  
- Check Ops Feed for hourly logs  
- Read About for ethos + links  

**UX Principles:** clarity first, humor second, minimal friction.

## 6 · System Architecture
Vercel (Next.js 14 + Tailwind)
↓ read
Supabase (Postgres)
├─ tables: tools · metrics · heartbeat_log
├─ views: tool_health_trends · heartbeat_recent
├─ trigger: purge_old_metrics() → deletes >7 days
└─ Edge Function 'heartbeat' → hourly metric drift


### 🩺 Heartbeat Cycle
1. Cron runs hourly.  
2. Function jitters tool health ± 3 pts & latency ± 300 ms.  
3. Writes metrics rows + updates tools.  
4. Logs run summary in `heartbeat_log`.  
5. Trigger cleans old metrics.

## 7 · Governance & Maintenance

| Function       | Mechanism                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Health updates | Supabase Edge Function + hourly cron              |
| Data cleanup   | 7-day retention trigger                           |
| Visibility     | `heartbeat_recent` view + Ops Feed                |
| Error handling | `status` column in log + UI icon                  |
| Indexing       | `metrics(check_time)` · `heartbeat_log(run_time)` |

## 8 · Roadmap & Delivery

| Phase          | Goal                        | Highlights                    |
