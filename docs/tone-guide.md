## 🧠 Core Voice

**Voice Statement:**  
Calm, competent, dryly self-aware.  

**Three Core Traits:**
| Trait           | Description                                                                            | Example                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Clarity**     | Prioritize precision and plain language. Avoid jargon unless it truly earns its place. | “Health: stable (ish).”             |
| **Calm**        | Even when describing chaos, stay grounded. Systems fail — we don’t.                    | “Nothing’s broken yet. Suspicious.” |
| **Humor (Dry)** | A wink, not a punchline. Irony over sarcasm. Light touch, never slapstick.             | “Deploying good intentions…”        |

**Voice summary:**  
> Confidence without pretense. Humor without noise. Clarity without apology.

## 🪶 Tone Spectrum

The tone shifts slightly by context — but the personality stays steady.

| Context                        | Tone                                           | Example                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **System status / dashboard**  | Calm, factual, slightly witty.                 | “Last heartbeat: 13 min ago — still fine.”      |
| **Errors / alerts**            | Gentle, non-blaming.                           | “Something misfired. It happens.”               |
| **Documentation**              | Conversational clarity; confident, not casual. | “This isn’t a bug — it’s a behavior.”           |
| **Public / portfolio content** | Intelligent, lightly narrative.                | “A system’s real test begins once it’s live.”   |
| **Commit messages / comments** | Direct and minimal.                            | `docs: update PRD for v1.3 metrics drift logic` |

## 💬 Writing Principles

### 1. **Say exactly what’s true**
  - Avoid exaggeration (“always,” “never,” “perfect”).
  - Replace fluff with fact — clarity is credibility.

### 2. **Explain, don’t perform**
  - Wit earns trust when it teaches or reveals, not distracts.
  - Humor should make the reader feel *in on it*, not on display.

### 3. **Use rhythm like logic**
  - Sentences should breathe.  
  - Short lines clarify.  
  - Long ones connect ideas.  

### 4. **Respect the reader’s brain**
  - Assume intelligence, not familiarity.  
  - Use metaphor sparingly and precisely.

### 5. **End with honesty**
  - If something’s uncertain, say so.  
  - “Probably fine” is better than false confidence.

## 🧩 Formatting Conventions

| Element       | Style                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Headings      | Title Case (for section headers)                    |
| Lists         | Use bullets for lists, numbered for steps           |
| Emphasis      | *Italics* for emphasis, **bold** for structure      |
| Quotes        | `>` for voice snippets or aphorisms                 |
| Code / tables | Use fenced code blocks (```) for diagrams or syntax |

## 🧭 Tone Check for New Writing

Before publishing or committing:
1. Would this make sense if it were read aloud calmly?  
2. Does it assume intelligence instead of proving it?  
3. Does it say something true, clearly?  
4. If it’s funny, is it kind?  

If all four are “yes,” it probably works in prod.
